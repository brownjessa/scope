## Description
  
The user is able to go to the **Scope Site**and search for their compatability with another individual based on their name and birth date. 

If a user makes an account on the Scope site they will be able to see a three day forecast of their hororscope. The three day forecast shows the past, current, and following days horoscope, color, lucky number, lucky
time, and mood of the day. 

Logged in users are able to store the days horoscope and look back at them over time as the past horoscopes and the date they were given are stored in their account.
